## Configuration
A small number of server settings can be configured in src/config.py:
- `HOST` - the host address the server will bind to.
- `PORT` - the port the server will bind to.



## Demo
1. Launch the server by running `src/app_server.py` with Python 3.10
2. Launch demo clients by running the following files with Python:
    - `src/launch_test_client_1.py`
    - `src/launch_test_client_2.py`
    - `src/launch_test_client_3.py`

3. The server console with display instructions on how to query the connected clients.


## Normal usage
1. Launch the server by running `src/app_server.py` with Python
2. Launch the clients by running `python src/client_main.py <path_to_virtual_root>`
