[Intro]
Cheer up Brian, you know what they say?
Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best
And...

[Chorus]
Always look on the bright side of life
(Whistle)
Always look on the light side of life
(Whistle)

[Verse 1]
If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly, chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing
And...

[Chorus]
Always look on the bright side of life
(Whistle) (Come on!)
Always look on the right side of life
(Whistle)

[Verse 2]
For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow

[Chorus]
So always look on the bright side of death
(Whistle)
A-Just before you draw your terminal breath
(Whistle)

[Verse 3]
Life's a piece of shit (Oooh)
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's the joke, it's true (Oooh)
You'll see it's all a show (Oooh)
Keep 'em laughin' as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you (Oooh)
And...

[Chorus]
Always look on the bright side of life
(Whistle)
Always look on the right side of life
(Whistle) (C'mon Brian, cheer up!)
[Outro]
Always look on the bright side of life
(Whistle)
Always look on the bright side of life
(Whistle)
(Worse things happen at sea, you know?)
Always look on the bright side of life
(Whistle) (What have you got to lose?
You know, you come from nothing
You're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!)
Always look on the bright side of life
(Whistle)
(Nothing will come from nothing
You know what they say?)
Always look on the bright side of life
(Cheer up, ya old bugger
C'mon, give us a grin!
There y'are, see?) (Whistle)
(It's the end of the film)
(Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer)
Always look on the bright side of life
(Some of us got to live as well, you know?) (Whistle)
(All right, that's the lot, let's get this place knocked down
The whole show's dismantled in three weeks
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish?)
Always look on the bright side of life
(They'll never make their money back, you know
I told 'im, I said to 'im, "Bernie," I said, "they'll never make their money back.") (Whistle)
Always look on the bright side of life
